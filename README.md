# Cheese_thermometer

One of the important elements in the production of cheeses is to monitor the temperature of the milk, hence the idea to build this thermometer. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I built the simplest possible way - a digital thermometer and an Oled display.

My intention is to expand this project by building a menu and memorizing cheese recipes - a short description of the next step to be precise. The encoder in the next release will control the entire thermometer.

So far, the basic version, working :)
